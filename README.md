## 📖 The Wisdom of the Disc

> **On Writing Code:**  
> *"The code is more what you'd call 'guidelines' than actual rules."*  
> (Paraphrased from the Thieves' Guild Manual)

> **On Debugging:**  
> *"It's still magic even if you know how it's done."*  
> — A Hat Full of Sky

> **On Stack Overflow:**  
> *"It is said that the Library at Unseen University contains every book that has ever been written, which is probably why it's so hard to find the one you want."*

> **Programming Philosophy:**  
> *"Do you not know that a man is not dead while his name is still spoken?"*  
> — Going Postal (and why we comment our code)
